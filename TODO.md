# Development Process

- Break Down into Modules: Divide the project into manageable pieces (user authentication, movie search, rating system, etc.).
- Start with Prototypes: Create wireframes and interactive prototypes to visualize the interface.
- Test Regularly: Run tests to ensure features work correctly.
- Iterate and Improve: Collect feedback and refine the design and functionality.
