# Development Process

- Break Down into Modules: Divide the project into manageable pieces (user authentication, movie search, rating system, etc.).
- Start with Prototypes: Create wireframes and interactive prototypes to visualize the interface.
- Test Regularly: Run tests to ensure features work correctly.
- Iterate and Improve: Collect feedback and refine the design and functionality.

## Design

### Technologies

Frontend:

- React Native / Kotlin (<https://reactnative.dev/>) for a mobile app experience
- React (<https://react.dev/>) for a web app.

Backend:

- Python (Flask)

- Database: A NoSQL database like MongoDB (<https://www.mongodb.com/>) offers flexibility and scalability for storing user data, movie/show information, watchlists, and reviews.

### System Architecture

Layered Architecture: Separate the application into distinct layers for better maintainability and scalability.

- Presentation Layer (Frontend): Handles user interface elements and interacts with the API layer.
- API Layer (Backend): Exposes functionalities through APIs for user interactions and data exchange between frontend and backend.
- Business Logic Layer (Backend): Implements core functionalities like user management, content retrieval, watchlist manipulation, and potentially recommendation logic.
- Data Access Layer (Backend): Handles communication with the database, storing and retrieving data.
- API Gateway: Implement an API Gateway like AWS API Gateway or Azure API Gateway to manage incoming API requests, routing them to the appropriate backend services.

- Load Balancing: Utilize a load balancer like AWS Elastic Load Balancing or Google Cloud Load Balancing to distribute traffic across multiple backend servers, ensuring scalability and handling high user loads.

### Security Considerations

- User Authentication: Implement secure user authentication with password hashing and consider options like two-factor authentication for added security.
- Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive user data like passwords at rest and in transit.
- API Security: Secure your APIs with authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

### Scalability

- Cloud Infrastructure: Consider deploying your application on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure. Cloud platforms offer scalability, fault tolerance, and easier management of resources.
- Microservices Architecture: As your application grows, consider adopting a microservices architecture. This breaks down the application into smaller, independent services that can be scaled independently.

### Monitoring and Logging

- Implement a monitoring system to track application performance, identify errors, and ensure smooth operation.
- Implement logging to record user actions and system events for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.

### Extras

- Offline Functionality: Allow users to browse watchlists or potentially downloaded content even when offline (limited functionality).
- Push Notifications: Implement push notifications (optional) to alert users about new releases, friend activity, etc.

## Wireframe

### Core Screens

- Home: This is the landing page. It could showcase trending content, user watchlist suggestions, or personalized recommendations.
- Browse: Allow users to explore the movie/show database. Consider filtering options by genre, year, or other categories.
- Search: A search bar to find specific movies or shows.
- Movie/Show Details: Dedicated page displaying details, ratings, reviews, trailers (if available), and options to add to watchlist or mark as watched.
- Profile: User profile settings with watch history, watchlist management, and potentially social features like friend lists.

### User Flow

- How will users add a movie/show to their watchlist? (From browse or details page)
- How will users see their watchlist items? (Dedicated watchlist screen)
- How will users rate and review a movie/show? (From the movie/show details page)

### Lo-Fi Wireframing

- Navigation: How will users move between screens? (Top or side navigation bar)
- Content Hierarchy: Prioritize information on each screen (Title, year, genre vs. reviews, ratings)
- Call to Action (CTA) Buttons: Clear buttons for adding to watchlist, marking as watched, etc.
- Placeholders for Content: Use boxes or shapes to represent images, text descriptions, and user input fields.

## Phases

### Ideation and Planning

- Solidify the project scope, identify success metrics, and create a high-level development timeline.

### Design and Prototyping

- This involves creating wireframes to visualize the app's interface and user flow. 
- You can then use these wireframes to build a basic, interactive prototype that allows users to experience the core functionalities.
- User testing with the prototype helps refine the design and identify usability issues before development.

### Development

Here, the actual coding of the app begins. You'll use the chosen technologies (frontend, backend, database) to build the app based on the finalized design and functionalities. This phase might involve breaking down the development into smaller tasks and milestones.

### Quality Assurance (QA) and Testing

Thorough testing is crucial to ensure the app functions as intended and is free of bugs. Testers will perform various tests, including functionality testing, usability testing, and performance testing.

### Deployment and Launch

- Once the app is thoroughly tested and deemed ready, it's time to deploy it on the chosen platform (App Store, Google Play Store, or web). 
- This might involve following specific guidelines and approval processes set by the platform.

### Maintenance and Updates

No app is ever truly finished. This phase involves addressing any bugs reported by users, releasing new features based on user feedback and market trends, and keeping the app compatible with the latest software updates.

### Additional Considerations

Security: Security measures should be implemented throughout the development process to protect user data and ensure overall system security.
Analytics and Monitoring: Integrate analytics tools to track user behavior and app performance. This data will be valuable for understanding user engagement and informing future improvements.
Marketing and Promotion: Develop a marketing strategy to reach your target audience and promote the app's launch and updates.
